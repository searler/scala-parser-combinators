========================

### Scala Standard Parser Combinator Library


__Modified to improve performance for specific use case and eliminate memory leak__

As of Scala 2.11, this library is a separate jar that can be omitted from Scala projects that do not use Parser Combinators.

## Documentation

 * [Latest version](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.11.2/scala-parser-combinators/)
 * [Previous versions](http://scala-lang.org/documentation/api.html) (included in the API docs for the Scala library until Scala 2.11)

## Adding an SBT dependency
To depend on scala-parser-combinators in SBT, add something like this to your build.sbt:

```
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.0.3"
```

(Assuming you're using a `scalaVersion` for which a scala-parser-combinators is published. The first 2.11 milestone for which this is true is 2.11.0-M4.)

To support multiple Scala versions, see the example in https://github.com/scala/scala-module-dependency-sample.
